            <h1>About C2 Club</h1>
            <p class="identity-paragraph">C2Club is a student-first peer learning platform built to help college students navigate academics, careers, skills, and mental pressure through shared experiences and real conversations.</p>

                <h2>The Story</h2>
                <p>C2 Club started with a simple observation: <strong>college life is confusing.</strong></p>
                <p>Students often feel isolated when it comes to studies, placements, and personal growth. Important tips, notes, and experiences remain scattered across different platforms, making it hard to find the right guidance at the right time.</p>
                <p>We built C2 Club to bring all of this together into one simple space where students can support each other.</p>

            <div class="section-card">
                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>We aim to create a positive and helpful student ecosystem where you can:</p>
                <ul class="section-list">
                    <li><strong>Connect</strong> with peers from different colleges.</li>
                    <li><strong>Share</strong> notes, tips, and real-life experiences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Discuss</strong> common problems without fear of judgment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Grow</strong> together instead of competing blindly.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h2>Why C2 Club?</h2>
                <p>We believe that <strong>real learning happens through shared experiences</strong>, not just in classrooms.</p>
                <p>Our long-term vision is to make C2 Club the go-to community platform for students across India — a place where every student can find guidance, motivation, and support throughout their academic journey.</p>
