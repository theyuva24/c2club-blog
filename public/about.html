            <h1>About C2 Club</h1>
            <p>C2 Club is a student community app built to help college students connect with each other, share useful resources, and learn from real experiences. The idea behind C2 Club started with a simple problem — students often feel confused, isolated, or lost during college life, especially when it comes to studies, placements, and personal growth.</p>
            <p>Many students struggle to find the right guidance at the right time. Important tips, notes, and experiences remain scattered across different platforms. C2 Club brings all of this together into one simple space where students can support each other.</p>
            <p>At C2 Club, our goal is to create a positive and helpful student ecosystem. Students can connect with peers from different colleges, share notes and tips, discuss common problems, and learn from each other’s journeys. Instead of competing blindly, students can grow together.</p>
            <p>We believe that real learning happens not just in classrooms, but through shared experiences. C2 Club is built to encourage collaboration, knowledge sharing, and meaningful conversations among students.</p>
            <p>Our long-term vision is to make C2 Club the go-to community platform for students across India — a place where every student can find guidance, motivation, and support throughout their academic journey.</p>
