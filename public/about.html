            <div class="section-card">
                <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                <p>When I was in college, I always wanted to work on something meaningful — projects, events, collaborations, or ideas that could create real impact. But I noticed a common pattern around me.</p>
                <p>Many students had ideas, curiosity, and potential, yet very few had the right ecosystem to act on them. Finding like-minded peers beyond one's own campus was difficult, and many opportunities happening in other colleges never reached students who would have loved to participate.</p>
                <p>At the same time, I realized something even more important:</p>
                <p><strong>Every year, students across thousands of colleges repeat the same struggles — searching for notes, previous-year questions, scholarship information, hostel insights, internship guidance, and real campus experiences — even though this knowledge already exists somewhere with other students or alumni.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <div class="section-card">
                <h2>The Missing Infrastructure</h2>
                <p>I explored existing digital platforms hoping they could solve this problem, but most were not built for students at the stage where they actually need support.</p>
                <ul class="section-list">
                    <li>Some platforms are designed mainly for entertainment and passive scrolling.</li>
                    <li>Others focus on professional networking for people already established in their careers.</li>
                    <li>Discussion-based platforms allow conversations, but they often lack structured communities, continuity of knowledge, and reliable peer ecosystems that students can consistently depend on.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Students did not need another content feed — they needed a collaboration-focused ecosystem.</strong></p>
                <p>That realization became the starting point of C2 Club.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section-card">
                <h2>What is C2 Club?</h2>
                <p>C2 Club is a student collaboration platform designed to connect learners across campuses, courses, and communities, creating a shared ecosystem where students can:</p>
                <ul class="section-list">
                    <li>Share notes, PYQs, and academic resources</li>
                    <li>Connect with seniors and alumni for real guidance</li>
                    <li>Discover scholarships, hostel insights, and campus survival information</li>
                    <li>Organize cross-college events, initiatives, and collaborative projects</li>
                    <li>Exchange books, resources, and student services</li>
                    <li>Participate in discussions — including anonymous conversations when needed</li>
                    <li>Build communities (Hubs) based on interests, colleges, locations, or ideas</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Instead of isolated college networks, C2 Club enables a cross-campus knowledge and collaboration ecosystem.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <div class="section-card">
                <h2>Why Another Platform?</h2>
                <p>Because students don't need another distraction platform — they need infrastructure for collaboration.</p>
                <p>Today, entertainment platforms capture attention, professional networks serve later career stages, and temporary messaging groups disappear with each semester. Valuable student knowledge resets every year. C2 Club is built to solve this structural gap by enabling continuous student-to-student and alumni-to-student knowledge flow across institutions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section-card">
                <h2>Built for Students, Free for Students</h2>
                <p>Access to opportunities, networks, and collaboration should never depend on affordability. That is why C2 Club is designed to remain free for students, ensuring that every learner — regardless of college or background — can participate in a shared ecosystem of growth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section-card">
                <h2>The Vision</h2>
                <p>C2 Club aims to become the digital collaboration layer for students, where ideas travel faster than boundaries, opportunities reach beyond campuses, and student potential is shaped by community rather than isolation.</p>
                <p><strong>Because when students are connected, informed, and empowered together — their growth multiplies.</strong></p>
