                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p><strong>Yes. Most students feel lost at some point</strong>—especially in the first 2–3 years. The problem is not confusion, it's facing it alone.</p>
                            <p>C2Club is built as a student-first peer platform where students can connect with others going through the same phase, helping you realize you're not behind—you're just early in figuring things out.</p>

                            <p>Grades matter, but <strong>skills, clarity, and peer learning matter more</strong>. Students who grow faster usually:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Talk to seniors</li>
                                <li>Learn from other students' mistakes</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>That's why C2Club focuses on student-to-student learning instead of generic textbook advice.</p>

                            <p>Yes—but not fake LinkedIn networking. <strong>Real networking is:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
